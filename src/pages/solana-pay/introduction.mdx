  This series is currently incomplete. The first few chapters are available, but the rest are still being written. We expected to be finished by January 2023.

This 10-part series on Advanced Solana Pay Development you will teach you how to create a Solana token faucet that distributes SPL tokens via a QR code. 
While the faucet is cool, the real goal is to teach the Solana community some of the techniques that are used to create production-ready applications powered by Solana Pay.

This tutorial is geared toward developers who are already familiar with [Solana](https://solana.com) and have a basic understanding of [Solana Pay](https://www.solanapay.com). If you're new to either of these, checkout these awesome resources:
