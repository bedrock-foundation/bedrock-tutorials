# Getting Started

<IncompleteCallout />

In this series we will be building a Solana token faucet. This is a fairly simple application. The focus here is more on the techniques used to build it rather than the application itself. We use the following stack to build the faucet:
1. [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Language & server runtime
2. [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Recoil.js](https://recoiljs.org/) + [Geist UI](https://geist-ui.dev/en-us) + [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/styled) - Web UI
3. [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Communication between clients and server
4. [SQLite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite) + [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Database & ORM
5. [@solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/) + [@solana/pay](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay) - Solana libraries
7. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - TLS tunneling for local development

We will be adding to this list of technologies as we improve our application over the duration of this series. The following features are already implemented in the [starter repository](https://github.com/bedrock-foundation/faucet-starter) and will be improved upon in future posts:


1. The admin can deposit SPL tokens into the faucet via Solana Pay.
2. The admin can withdraw SPL tokens from the faucet via Solana Pay.
3. The admin can set the amount of tokens that can be claimed from the faucet per account.
4. The admin can view information on a webapp about how wallets are interacting with the faucet.
5. Users can redeem tokens from the faucet via Solana Pay.

The rest of this section will cover setting up the development environment and running the [starter repository](https://github.com/bedrock-foundation/faucet-starter).

## Project Setup

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) to install or update the Solana CLI tool suite. We are using version 1.9.29.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
 ```bash
 $ git clone git@github.com:bedrock-foundation/faucet-starter.git
 $ cd faucet-starter
 $ npm install
 ```

Create a new keypair to use for the faucet. **Note:** this is a private key and should never be shared.
 ```bash
 $ solana-keygen new --no-passphrase --outfile ~/.config/solana/keys/bedrock-faucet-tutorial.json
 ```
Update the `FAUCET_SECRET_KEY_PATH` value in the `.env` file in the root of the project with the absolute path to the keypair you just created. For example, my path looks like:
 ``` 
 FAUCET_SECRET_KEY_PATH=/Users/sam-bedrock/.config/solana/keys/bedrock-faucet-tutorial.json
 ```

By default this project uses the free RPC endpoint for Solana mainnet-beta, however it is likely you will surpass the RPC [rate-limits](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints#mainnet-beta). If you want to use a different RPC provider (we recommend [Syndica](https://syndica.io/)), update the `SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT` value in the `.env` file:

 ``` 
 SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://solana-api.syndica.io/access-token/<YOUR_SYNDICA_API_TOKEN_HERE>/rpc
 ```

 Start the application in development mode:
 ```bash
 $ npm run dev
 ```
 Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You should see the following view:
