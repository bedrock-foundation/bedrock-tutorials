This 8-part series on Advanced Solana Pay Development you will teach you how to create a Solana token faucet that distributes SPL tokens via a QR code. 
While the faucet is cool, the real goal is to teach the Solana community some of the techniques that are used to create production-ready applications powered by Solana Pay.

This tutorial is geared toward developers who are already familiar with [Solana](https://solana.com) and have a basic understanding of [Solana Pay](https://www.solanapay.com). If you're new to either of these, checkout these awesome resources:

Nextra supports [Next.js Internationalized Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) out of the box.

To add multi-language pages to your Nextra application, just need to config `i18n` in `next.config.js`:

```ts
const withNextra = require('nextra')('nextra-theme-docs', './theme.config.js')
module.exports = withNextra({
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en', 'zh', 'de'],
    defaultLocale: 'en'
  }
})
```

Then, add the locale codes to your file extensions (required for the default locale too):

```plaintext
/pages
  index.en.md
  index.zh.md
  index.de.md
  meta.en.json
  meta.zh.json
  meta.de.json
  ...
```

Finally, add the `i18n` option to your `theme.config.js` to configure the language dropdown:

```jsx filename="theme.config.js"
i18n: [
  { locale: 'en', text: 'English' },
  { locale: 'zh', text: '中文' },
  { locale: 'de', text: 'Deutsch' },
  { locale: 'ar', text: 'العربية', direction: 'rtl' }
]
```
